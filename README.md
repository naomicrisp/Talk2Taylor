This app was a mini hackathon challenge I set for myself in order to practice fetching from APIs, creating React Apps, and wireframing a responsive UI. In it's current state, it's around 60% done. The functionality is simple, but achieves what I set out for it to. 

# Upcoming installments

- Improve UI, implement web layout wireframe, finetune responsiveness
- Include unit tests to check the API call is working, and the page layout is responsive
